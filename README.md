# Zotero Addons

In this repository are a few [citation styles](//www.zotero.org/support/dev/citation_styles) I made for [Zotero](//zotero.org) whilst I was studying at [Moore Theological College](//moore.edu.au).

These styles are based heavily on the [Society for Biblical Literature](//www.sbl-site.org) style guide, though modified according to MTC's requirements. They don't work perfectly, but work well enough, and I'd love to see them improved.

The [main csl](moore-theological-college.csl) file is the most up to date whilst the [*alt* version](moore-theological-college-alt.csl) has some experimental features.
